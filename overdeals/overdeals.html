            <p class="grey-color">Eat all the food. Drink all the drinks. Be entertained. Think of nothing beyond having a great time, making a splash in the pool and soaking up sun on the beach. All-inclusive getaways mean you and your family are having all the carefree fun you’ve been dreaming about. Free cancellation on most hotels. Some hotels require you to cancel more than 24 hours before check in. Please check the site for details. Note: International destinations may have travel restrictions in place due to COVID-19. Please check federal, state and local advisories before scheduling trips. </p>

            <h3 class="bold">Find all-inclusive resort deals</h3>
            <p class="bold">Where are there all-inclusive resorts?</p>
            <p class="grey-color">All-inclusive resorts can be found all over the world, but they are most common in tropical locations, such as the Yucatán Peninsula, the Caribbean and Thailand. Travelocity has last-minute, all-inclusive travel deals available for when you decide it’s time to take some time off work and relax.</p>
            <p class="bold">What does all-inclusive mean for resorts?</p>
            <p class="grey-color">All-inclusive deals usually mean that your hotel or resort includes your accommodations, meals, drinks and activities at a fixed price. In many cases, all-inclusive resorts also include alcoholic drinks for guests of legal drinking age, so you can relax by the pool with a cocktail in hand and not worry about racking up a bill. Depending on which all-inclusive resort you book, included activities may range from regional tours and water sports to private beach access and spa services.

                Though lots of all-inclusive resorts are for adults, there are many that cater to families; these typically offer additional kid-focused activities and entertainment. For people who want to arrive at their destination, relax and receive first-class treatment, all-inclusive resorts are the perfect choice.</p>
            <p class="bold">Are drinks free in all-inclusive resorts?</p>
            <p class="grey-color">Most all-inclusive resorts offer free non-alcoholic drinks, and some offer free alcoholic drinks (sometimes as part of the resort fee). If you are looking to have alcoholic beverages included in your package, it’s a good idea to double-check when you book—sometimes there is an additional charge for including unlimited alcohol. If you are considering a trip and would like to stay at a resort that will take care of all your needs, take a look at Travelocity’s all-inclusive vacation deals.</p>
